# QR-Code-Component-FEM-Challenge
This is the QR Code Componenet Challenge provided by Frontend Mentor

This is the best solution I could come up with, with my limited knowledge of css. In this project, at this point in time I have only provided
a desktop version, as I am still not 100% sure on @media querys. Any feedback would be greatly appreciated

Best Regards
