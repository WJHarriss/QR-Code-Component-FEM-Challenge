This is the best solution I could come up with, with my limited knowledge of css. In this project, at this point in time I have only provided
a desktop version, as I am still not 100% sure on @media querys. Any feedback would be greatly appreciated

Best Regards

Based on some feedback received by a very friendly person over on Frontend Mentor, I have made some changes to my code, those changes are as follows.

1) Gave one of my divs the role="main" attribute.
  This is not something I realised needed to be done, so I fixed it.
2) Add a h1 heading.
  This was also a mandatory thing which I did not realise
and finally
3) Added a font from google fonts.
I did not originally know how to do this, so it was definetly good to learn something new.

Best Regards
